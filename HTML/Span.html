    <p>In this page i am using the p tag here.. have a look!!... The <span>HyperText Markup Language<span> or HTML is the standard
        markup language for documents designed to be displayed in a web browser. It defines the meaning and structure of
        web content. It is often assisted by technologies such as Cascading Style Sheets (CSS) and scripting languages
        such as JavaScript</p>

         <!-- To seperate the small part to style it incss, might not be able to see the span part here -->
